This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

HOWEVER, this is currently a work in progress, so I don't suggest you make any attempt to get this application up and running.

This is an appliation I'm developing to showcase some of the skills I've learned as a Web Developer. The intent is to use this during my application process.
